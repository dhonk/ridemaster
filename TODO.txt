- CHANGE TO CLARKE WRIGHT
    issue is that nearest neighbor doesn't actually produce optimal routes
    problem will always be a single depot problem: either everyone will be departing from one point to another singular points, (depot to depot), or will be picked up from home to one location (treat destination as depot), or will be leaving one location to be taken home (single depot)
- add google maps api calls for distance
- begin discord api integration:
  - 1 Start with just putting rides lists into discord
  - 2 Server specific user config, so that individual members can set name, address
  - 3 O shoot I think imma have to add a name field in the human class too
  - 4 Then set up the reaction feature in order to set up rides based on server profiles
      - Server profile will need:
      - Storage of the discord id, the name, driver/rider status, if driver, capacity, address
  - 5 Then set up the actual command function: in order to set either unified start, unified drop off, or dist pick up, dist drop off
  - 6 Also add command in order for people to select whether or not they will be driving
  - 7 Also add command for custom car:
      - eg we're all leaving large group, can pick a car to get into through reactions
