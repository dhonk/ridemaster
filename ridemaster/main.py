Current thought process:

For set of drivers:
    1. Find closest rider
    2. If rider isn't already in a car, pick up in car
    3. Continue until seats filled / riders exhausted

okie googlemaps kinda hard     

lets start w the actual alg

lets start with a rider object
-- should driver be a separate object??
